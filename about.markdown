Hi! I'm Eduardo Guti√©rrez Silva a non-FANG/MANA Software Engineer, doing DevOps. I still keep the SwE thing because that's what I like to do, it's just that sometimes I get too focused in learning as much as I want that I end up doing other stuff, yeah pretty much your Jack of all trades.

Thanks for reading my about page. I'm currently living in Canada after I finished my post-graduate certificate in Big Data Solution Architecture. I love it here and I will continue to work for one more year (if that's what the IRCC decides).

My mind wonders on doing mobile application development and frontend again, while using serverless backends, exploiting the cloud providers free-tiers, but I still haven't had the time to design or implement anything, it's all just in my mind at the moment.

If you're a recruiter, thanks for looking here, not that many people .

I'm not looking after support role opportunities, only the couple interviews I've already had have been stressful enough to know that's something I've never done nor have training to cope with yelling customers. Software Engineering I will gladly speak with anyone, because clearly I'm just good enough to be doing what I do, but never gone too deep to solve enough _Hard_ Leetcode problems.

This about page is getting lengthy. If you'd like to know more about me, you can stalk me in my social networks or LinkedIn, hopefully available by now as part of the available links.

Thanks for reading!
